# VERT

VERT is a next-generation file converter that runs entirely in your browser using WebAssembly. It allows you to convert files directly on your device without uploading them to the cloud, ensuring privacy and security. VERT supports over 250+ file formats including images, audio, documents, and video files, with no file size limits.
